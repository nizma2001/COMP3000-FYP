# COMP3000-FYP
 Digital Archiving System -  Final Year Project 24/25

Project Vision & Background

Vision

The vision of this project is to create a platform that aims to provide a robust, secure, and user-friendly solution for storing, encrypting, and retrieving important files for personal use or in organisations such as libraries. 
The product ensures that sensitive documents are protected from unauthorized access and preserved in compliance with data privacy regulations, such as GDPR. The main aim of the product is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data.

Project Overview

This project, a cloud-based file storage system with blockchain integration for file integrity, focuses on addressing key challenges in cybersecurity today. It combines the convenience of cloud storage with the security of blockchain technology to ensure uploaded files remain safe and untampered. The system includes features like user authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and metadata storage for user and file details, making it highly practical and secure.

The project is particularly relevant due to the growing concerns about cyberattacks such as data breaches and ransomware. These threats highlight the importance of keeping stored data authentic and secure. Blockchain technology plays a crucial role here by providing an unchangeable record to verify files’ integrity and offer a trusted audit trail. As more organizations move their data to the cloud, the need for secure platforms that guarantee compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA has also increased, making this project very timely and useful.
